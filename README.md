## Overview
MetroMate is a travel companion app that allows you to take full advantage of King Countyâ€™s metro system. It provides access to many features which are useful when riding public transport, like directional assistance and route finding and mapping, location visibility for all buses, and location saving. It also includes other features, such as several settings to customize your experience and a resources finder that allows people of lower-income status to easily access food, shelter, and other various resources.
## Route Finder
The route finder uses an advanced algorithm to determine the optimal route to get to your destination, prioritizing getting as close as possible. Once it has created a route, you can easily map out all the stops on your route, as well as detailed instructions that outline when to get on and off, and what bus routes to take. While waiting for your bus, you can easily see the location of the bus you need to take. While on the bus, you can view a map of the route so you know exactly what path the bus is taking.
## Resource Search
The resources menu uses the Google Places API to find a list of food banks, shelters, or police stations that are near the user. It then lists all of these resources as buttons you can press to immediately find a way to get there using buses. The combination of route mapping and resource search makes it very easy and accessible for people to get the help they need.
